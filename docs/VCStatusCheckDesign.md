# Verifiable Credentials Status check

This design document outlines the approach for implementing status checks for Verifiable Credentials (VCs) within our system. The goal is to ensure that the status of a VC can be verified efficiently and securely, allowing relying parties to determine whether a credential is valid, revoked, or suspended.

### Overview

W3C Data model 2.0 supports status checking for Verifiable Credentials through the use of a `credentialStatus` property. This property points to a status list that can be queried to determine the current status of the credential.

### High level user flow

#### Flow : User lands on Inji Web application and views stored VCs with their status

- The user logs in and opens the Stored Cards page.
- For each credential in the wallet, mimoto will check the status using the VC verifier library. 
- For the W3C Data model 2.0 VCs, we need to pass status list credential cache data if available to the library. If cache is missing, the library should skip status list check for the credential.
- The status returned by the library will be stored in the database and shown to the user alongside each credential. The last checked time will be updated to the time at which status list cache was created - if there are multiple list involved then minimum time will be updated in the database. 
- If there are multiple status list credentials involved for a VC, all the status list should be available in the cache for status list check to be performed. If any one of them is missing, status list check will be skipped for that VC.
- For credentials that were added before migrating to the latest application, their status will be set to valid by default using a database migration script.
- The status will be returned as an array. Mimoto will return all applicable status purposes for a credential as-is, without any transformation. Converting these into user-friendly labels will be handled by Inji Web.
- If status list is not applicable for a credential, only schema validation and signature verification results will be returned based on the validity period of the credential. The last checked time will be updated to current time for the credentials in this case.
- The applicable check is already done by the VC Verifier library based on the credential type and data model version, no additional logic is needed in Mimoto for this.

```

#### Flow : User clicks on 'Check card status' option for a credential
- The user selects the 'Check card status' option for a specific credential in their wallet.
- Mimoto invokes the VC Verifier library to check the status of the credential. Finally updates the status details in the database.
- Mimoto updates the status list cache too with the latest status list credential received from the issuer.
- Last checked time is updated to the current time for the credential.

#### Flow 3 : User adds a credential to wallet

- User logs in to Inji Web application
- Selects and adds a new verifiable credential to their wallet
- During the addition process, the system performs an immediate status check for the newly added credential using the VC Verifier library
- The system updates the status of the credential in the database based on the result of the status check and caches the status list
- The user is notified of the successful addition of the credential along with its current status
- The newly added credential is now available in the user's wallet with its status displayed
- If any error during status check, the user is notified with an error message and the credential is not added to the wallet.

    ],
    "lastCheckedAt": "2025-12-11T10:30:00Z"
  }
]
```

#### Check Credential Status

**Endpoint**: `GET /wallets/{walletId}/credentials/{credentialId}/status`

**Description**: Retrieves the current status of a specific credential from the issuer.

**Path Parameters**:
- `walletId` (string, required): Unique identifier of the wallet

  "isSchemaAndSignatureValid": true,
  "isExpired": false,
  "statusChecks": [
    {"purpose": "revocation", "valid":true },
    {"purpose": "suspension", "valid":true }
  ],  
  "lastCheckedAt": "2025-12-11T10:30:00Z",
  "message": "string (optional)"
}
```

**Response Fields**:
- `credentialId`: The unique identifier of the credential
- `isSchemaAndSignatureValid`: Boolean indicating if the schema and signature validation passed
- `isExpired`: Boolean indicating if the credential has expired
- `statusChecks`: Array of status purposes and their validity
- Each object in the array contains:
  - `purpose`: The purpose of the status check (e.g., revocation, suspension)
  - `valid`: Boolean indicating if the credential is valid for that purpose. `true` means valid, `false` means invalid i.e. revoked, suspended, etc.
- `lastCheckedAt`: Timestamp of the most recent status check
- `message`: Optional message providing additional context, especially in case of error

**Error Responses**:

- **404 Not Found**: Credential or wallet not found
```json
{
  "errorCode": "CREDENTIAL_NOT_FOUND",
  "message": "Credential with ID {credentialId} not found for wallet {walletId}"
}
```

- **400 Bad Request**: Invalid request parameters
```json
{
  "errorCode": "INVALID_REQUEST",
  "message": "Invalid walletId or credentialId format"
}
```

```json
{
  "errorCode": "INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR",
  "message": "An unexpected error occurred while checking credential status"
}
```

**Behavior Notes**:
- The `lastCheckedAt` timestamp always reflects when the status was actually last verified with the issuer
- In case of any error during status check, the existing status in the database remains unchanged
- The status list credential cache is updated only on successful status checks

### Database Schema

#### verifiable_credentials Table

This table stores the verifiable credentials along with their status information. Four columns to be introduced for status tracking : 

| Column Name               | Data Type | Nullable? | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
|---------------------------|-----------|-----------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| is_expired                | BOOLEAN   | Yes       | Indicates if the credentials has expired or not. Will be NULL for migrated credential where expired status is not known.                                                                                          |
| is_schema_signature_valid | BOOLEAN   | No        | If signature and schema validation has passed successfully.                                                                                                                                                       |
| status_checks             | JSONB     | Yes       | Current status purpose array for the credential derived from status list credential (e.g., revocation, suspension) . E.g. `[ {"purpose": "revocation", "valid":true }, {"purpose": "suspension", "valid":true }]` |
| status_last_checked_at    | TIMESTAMP | No        | Timestamp of the last status check performed                                                                                                                                                                      |

### Migration of existing credentials

A one-time migration script will be executed to initialize the `is_schema_signature_valid` and `status_last_checked_at` fields for existing credentials in the `verifiable_credentials` table. The script will set the `is_schema_signature_valid` value to true and the `status_last_checked_at` to the current timestamp.


### Caching Strategy

To optimize performance and reduce redundant network calls to issuers for status checks, a caching mechanism will be implemented for status list credentials. The cache will store the status list credentials retrieved from issuers, allowing for quick access during subsequent status checks.

#### Cache Structure
The cache will be structured as follows:
- **Cache Name**: `statusListCredential`
- **Key**: `statusListId` - Unique identifier for the status list credential. The value will be value of `statusListCredential` field in `credentialStatus` object in Data model 2.0 VCs. E.g. https://injicertify-farmer.dev-int-inji.mosip.net/v1/certify/credentials/status-list/a7b3ac9a-861a-4fa3-9c85-27e79d35fad3
- **Value**:
  - `statusListCredential`: The actual bitstring retrieved from the status list credential
  - `fetchedAt`: Timestamp indicating when the status list credential was fetched
- **Expiration Policy**: Each cache entry will have a Time-To-Live (TTL) of 24 hours. After this period, the entry will be considered stale and will be refreshed upon the next status check request. This can be configured via configuration.

### VC Verifier Library modifications
- The VC Verifier library will be updated to accept an optional parameter for the status list credential cache. 
- When performing status checks, the library will first check the provided cache for the required status list credential. If found, it will use the cached version; otherwise, it will skip the status list check for that credential. 
- Existing functionality of the library will remain unchanged if no cache is provided.

#### Implementation Details
- Method signature to be modified for verifyAndGetCredentialStatus for VC Verifier library:

```kotlin
fun verifyAndGetCredentialStatus(
        credential: String,
        credentialFormat: CredentialFormat,
        statusPurposeList: List<String> = emptyList(),
        statusListCredentialCache: Map<String, StatusListCredentialCacheEntry> = emptyMap()
    ): CredentialVerificationSummary
```

- This new param will further be passed to the internal method which extracts status from status list credential(s). When this param is passed, http calls will not be made to fetch status list credential(s) from issuer.
- Existing data class `CredentialStatusResult` will be updated to return status list credential(s) as well when http calls are made to fetch status list credential(s) from issuer : 

```kotlin
data class CredentialStatusResult(
    val isValid: Boolean,
    val error: StatusCheckException?,
    val statusListCredential: JsonLDObject? = null
)
```
- The new field will be null when status list credential is fetched from cache or if its not applicable for the credential.
